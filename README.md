## My process

I just completed another FrontEnd Mentor Newbie challenge and using the previously discovered information about Flexbox, I visually identified the sections that would be needed to create a vertical flexbox. That would be the container with radial corners, QR code image, heading and a paragraph. I also started with a "mobile-first" approach, which was a lesson from before. 

To begin, I reviewed the mobile and desktop images and the size of the QR code image in each, both were the same and the look was the same on either device, so I decided the page did not need to be 'responsive'. I started work on the html structure, before styling the css. I started with styling the elemnents I knew then reviewed guides on CSS Flexbox, applying radial corners to images and borders, then finally positioning the card vertically, which I did not succeeed at and would welcome feedback as to why! 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to acheive radial corners on images and how to align flex items correctly. I also learned through curiosity how to apply CSS custom properties. 

### Continued development

I'll immediately start a new project with a little more complexity, using only HTML and CSS and look to join a social group where I can ask questions. 

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - Great site on Flexbox. 
- [Kevin Powell - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Excellent resource for beginners, easy to follow and understand, highly recommended.
